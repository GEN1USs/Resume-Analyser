# Resume-Analyser
The Resume Analyzer is an AI-powered tool that classifies resumes as Good Fit, Partial Fit, or Not a Fit based on job descriptions. It uses NLP and a BERT-based model to extract key features, providing an interactive web interface via Streamlit and an API with FastAPI, making resume screening more efficient.
